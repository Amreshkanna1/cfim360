# CFIM360° — Meta-Scientific Architecture of Inner Intelligence

**CFIM360° (Creative First Impact Model 360°)** is a meta-scientific research architecture that defines and governs multiple interconnected inner-intelligence universes.

It establishes the foundational structure for **Emotional Physics, Cognitive Physics, and Somatic Physics**, and their applied cybernetic systems, forming a single coherent model of inner intelligence across humans, machines, and hybrid systems.

CFIM360° operates as the sovereign architecture above:
- Emotional Cybernetics (EC)
- Cognitive Cybernetics (CC)
- Somatic Cybernetics (SC)
- EIOS (applied emotional–cognitive operating systems)
- Universal Measurement Frameworks (UMF)

These domains are not independent frameworks, but formally governed layers within the CFIM360 research architecture.

## Core Principle

CFIM360° models how inner intelligence forms and stabilizes through a universal triad:

**Creation → Impact → Model**

This triad describes:
- how inner signals are generated,
- how they shape perception, behavior, and decision-making,
- how they reorganize into stable, measurable intelligence structures.

This principle applies uniformly across emotional, cognitive, somatic, and artificial systems.
